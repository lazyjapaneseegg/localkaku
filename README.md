# localkaku
local version of henkaku, automated because I'm a lazy egg.

How to use
==========
- `npm install`
- `node index`

If you want to update to latest version of henkaku run:
`node index --reinstall`

Info
====
You need node 6, babel-node should also work with lower versions.

If for some reason future version of henkaku change the way its patched, you add `--use-python-build`
to your command to run the embedded `build.sh` file, if you do, you need python3 installed.
